1\. **About the Website**

&#x20;Welcome to Joltify.io and its subdomains such as docs.joltify.io, app.joltify.io etc (the **'Website**'). The Website provides access to the Joltify chain (  ‘**Joltify**’, or '**Joltify Chain**', or ‘**Joltify Protocol**’), a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain governed by the Joltify DAO consisting of JOLT token holders (the '**Services**'). For the avoidance of doubt, any references to Services also refers to the use of the Joltify Chain. The Services is provided through free, public, and open-source software blockchain,

(a) The Website is operated by DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC. (or ‘**We**’ or ‘**Us**’ or the '**Company**') Access to and use of the Website, or any of its associated Products or Services, is provided by DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC.

**About Joltify protocol**

&#x20;(c) Joltify is a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain that aims to bridge real world assets to the decentralized finance world. Joltify is a lending platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrency tokens, such as USDT,Atom,,BNB, etc. Joltify is designed to amalgamate liquidity in the crypto world to real world financial assets. Joltify will allow traditional asset managers to tokenise, by minting tokens on Joltify (“**Products**”) and offer real world asset investment opportunities to accredited investors via cryptocurrency and smart contracts or other blockchain technologies.

(d)Blockchain is a rapidly changing technology. The crypto industry also involves rapidly changing business models. We and Joltify reserve the right to make changes to our technology and business models, including but not limited to developing new Products and Services for broad applications, or moving to other blockchains or chaning to other blockchain applications completely.

(e)Joltify is using bridge technology developed by the team at DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC as part of the Services. This technology is an open-source software licensed under the Apache v2 license and can be used freely by any third parties. The purpose of using the bridge in Joltify is to make it easy to transfer tokens in and out of the platform.

DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC may continue to develop and use its bridge technology in other projects that the Company develops. Joltify may not follow all updates to the bridge technology, as its current business model is focused on digital and real-world asset lending. The purpose of Joltify's use of the bridge is not to generate revenue, though it may potentially bring value to JOLT token in other ways.

In the future, Joltify may choose to terminate the use of the Company's bridge in its own chain and instead use bridges from other projects or chains as part of the Services, either from DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC or from other third-party projects,softwares or chains, in order to diversify risks and focus on its core business.

&#x20;

15\. **Governing Law**

&#x20;

(a) The Terms are governed by the laws of British Virgin Islands. Any dispute, controversy, proceeding or claim of whatever nature arising out of or in any way relating to the Terms and the rights created hereby shall be governed, interpreted and construed by, under and pursuant to the laws of British Virgin Islands, without reference to conflict of law principles, notwithstanding mandatory rules. The validity of this governing law clause is not contested. The Terms shall be binding to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns.

&#x20;

16\. **Independent Legal Advice and Acknowledgement**

&#x20;

(a) Both parties confirm and declare that the provisions of the Terms are fair and reasonable and both parties having taken the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice and declare the Terms are not against public policy on the grounds of inequality or bargaining power or general grounds of restraint of trade.

(b) User acknowledges that Blockchains and smart contracts are still emerging technologies that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. For example, User’s assets interacting with the Services may be vulnerable to hacking events, including Bridge Risks described in (c). The mere access to and interaction with blockchains and smart contracts requires a high degree of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including (without limitation) use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies (such as blockchains) is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with the Website may be publicly visible and readable in human form.

(c)Decentralized management accounts in both public chains and Joltify are shared by all Users. While this adds liquidity to the bridge, it also increases the risk of the bridge being hacked or suffering from other issues (“Bridge Risks”). Building a bridge between different chains is a complex task, and the rapidly changing nature of blockchain technology adds to the difficulty. For example, transferring tokens between chains does not physically move tokens from one chain to another, but involves locking tokens in one chain and releasing tokens in another chain, i.e. tokens are pooled rather than atomic stored. Despite this, the bridge is a crucial function in connecting different chains, as without it, block chains are like isolated islands. Joltify will take all necessary measures to protect the safety of the accounts and the bridge, but there is no guarantee that the bridge will be completely risk-free. Users should be aware that they bear the risks of hacking, chain breaks, liquidity crunches, and other issues if they choose to use the bridge as part of the Services and Joltify chain.

(d) By accessing and using the Website and Services, the User acknowledges the foregoing and agrees and represents that it understands such and other risks involved with blockchains and the Website. The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, and the Website. The User further acknowledges that any crypto-assets the User places or uses within the Website may increase or decrease in value rapidly while they are involved with the Website, or be obtained by other parties or otherwise lost in ways the User may or may not currently foresee (possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment). The User agrees that we are not responsible for any of these (or related) risks, do not own or control the Website, and cannot be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all the risks of accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and Services. If the User is a California resident, the User waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “\[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

&#x20;

17\. **Entire Agreement**

&#x20;

(a) The Terms and any document incorporated by reference herein constitute the sole and entire agreement between the User and Us regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website and Services.

&#x20;

18\. **Severance**



(a) If any part of these Terms is found to be void or unenforceable by a Court of competent jurisdiction, that part shall be severed and the rest of the Terms shall remain in force.

19\. **Assignment**



(a) The Terms may be assigned without your prior consent to any DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC associate, or to its successors in the interest of any business associated with the Services provided by us. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under the Terms.

&#x20;
