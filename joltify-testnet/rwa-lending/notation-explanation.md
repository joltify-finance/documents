# Notation Explanation

There are three pivotal pages for RWA investing:

1. [**The "RWA" Page**](notation-explanation.md#the-rwa-page)
2. [**The "Project" Page**](notation-explanation.md#the-project-page)
3. [**The "Personal Investment" Page**](notation-explanation.md#the-personal-investment-page)

For a better understanding of the RWA project investing process, we've provided explanations for the notations used on each page.

## The "RWA" Page

The ”RWA“ page showcases basic details of all listed RWA projects. Specifically, each RWA project provides the following information:

* **SPV Name**: displays the name of the project.
* **Investment Capacity**: represents the specific asset and its corresponding amount sought by the SPV.
* **Asset Maturity**: denotes the duration for project completion.
* **Target APY**: specifies the highest Annual Percentage Yield (APY) provided by the project.
* **My Invest**: reflects the total investment of the current account in the chosen project.

## The "Project" Page

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/rwa2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 2: The Project page shows the details of created pools in a RWA project.</p></figcaption></figure>

The ”Project“ page offers both a general overview and a deeper dive into the specifics of the chosen project, broken down into two primary sections:

* **Project Details:** This section provides a succinct overview of the project's main attributes and metrics.
* **Project Introduction:** Here, you'll find a comprehensive introduction to the project, explaining its objectives, scope, and other relevant information.

Within this project, there are two pools: the `-junior` pool and the `-senior` pool. Below are the notations and their respective explanations for each pool:

* **Pool Name**: displays the name of the pools.
* **Pool Status**: provides the current operational status of the pool. The possible statuses are:
  * PREPARE
  * INACTIVE
  * ACTIVE
  * PoolPayPartial
  * FREEZING
  * FROZEN
* **APY**: represents the Annual Percentage Yield for the respective pool, indicating the returns on investments.
* **My Invest**: reflects the amount an individual has invested in that particular pool.
* **Target Completion Percentage**: shows the proportion of assets raised that have been borrowed. The calculation for the target completion percentage is $$\frac{Invested\ Assets}{Invested\ Assets + Committed\ Assets}$$.

## The "Personal Investment" Page
