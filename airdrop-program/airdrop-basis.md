# Airdrop Basis

## Credit JOLT (cJOLT) Tokens

All participants who complete the tasks of the proposed activities will be rewarded with **cJOLT** tokens. Users' **cJOLT** tokens can be redeemed into **JOLT** tokens once the Mainnet is alive.

***

## Rewarding Mechanism

The Joltify Team gives away up to **1,000,000 JOLT** tokens through the [Start-Up Airdrop](activity-1-start-up-airdrop.md) and [Weekly Airdrop](activity-2-weekly-airdrop.md) activities. All participants in the above two activities will share a total supply of up to **1,000,000 JOLT** tokens. If the total number of cJOLT gives out is <mark style="color:orange;">smaller and equal to</mark> **100,000,000,** the cJOLT and JOLT redemption ratio is 100:1 (shown in case 1), otherwise the following function is applied (shown in case 2).

$$Redeemed\ JOLT\ = \frac{The\ number\ of\   Owned\ cJOLT}{The\ total\ distributed\ cJOLT} * 1,000,000\ JOLT$$

#### Case 1

Alice has obtained **200,000 cJOLT** in proposed airdrop campaigns and the total distributed cJOLT is **90,000,000 cJOLT**. At the end of the closing stage, Alice can claim (300,000 / 100) JOLT tokens, which are **2,000 JOLT** tokens.

#### Case 2

Alice has obtained **300,000 cJOLT** in proposed airdrop campaigns and the total distributed cJOLT is **120,000,000 cJOLT**. At the end of the closing stage, Alice can claim \[(300,000 / 120,000,000) \*  1,000,000] JOLT tokens, which are **2,500 JOLT** tokens.

## Claim cJOLT tokens

After completing any task in the [Start-Up Airdrop](activity-1-start-up-airdrop.md) and [Weekly Airdrop](activity-2-weekly-airdrop.md) activities, the participants are required to claim their cJOLT tokens in the Airdrop channel of Joltify's Discord.

The claim method is demonstrated in the proposed task.
